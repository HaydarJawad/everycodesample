This extension allows you to copy and paste directly from the browser to a Google Doc. The document must be open for this feature to work.
In other words, you do not need to manually paste the copied content back into the document. Once you copy the content, 
it will be automatically pasted into the document. This makes life easier, eliminating the need for back and forth copying and pasting.
